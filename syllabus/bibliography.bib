	abstract = {Effective Computation in Physics is a handy guide to the types of problems you run into with computational physics{\textemdash}such as version control, bash scripts, object orientation, large databases, and parallel machines. The authors provide detailed scientific computing motivations, clear and concise tutorials, and references to further information about each of the topics presented.This book fills the existing training gap for students and scientists who conduct physics in a world where simulations have replaced desktop experiments and sophisticated data traversing algorithms have replaced pen and paper analysis.Provides a central source that ties various pieces of computational physics togetherContains coverage of the Python programming language aimed toward physicistsHelps you properly analyze and compellingly visualize your dataIncludes chapters on hot topics like NumPy and HDF5},

abstractNote = {The purpose of this book is to explain the most important physical concepts and mathematical methods commonly used in predicting the behavior of neutrons in nuclear reactors An effort has been made to avoid mathematical complexity that does not lead to a significant increase in physical understanding or is not used in actual reactor design studies In a few instances, therefore, where it appears justified, lengthy derivations have been omitted and only the conclusion given, with references to the relevant literature},

abstract = {"Nuclear reactor physics is the core discipline of nuclear engineering. Nuclear reactors now account for a significant portion of the electrical power generated worldwide, and new power reactors with improved fuel cycles are being developed. At the same time, the past few decades have seen an ever-increasing number of industrial, medical, military, and research applications for nuclear reactors. The second edition of this successful comprehensive textbook and reference on basic and advanced nuclear reactor physics has been completely updated, revised and enlarged to include the latest developments."--Jacket.},
