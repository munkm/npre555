# NPRE 555: Nuclear Reactor Theory 

This is the repository that holds the syllabus
assignments, and other materials for Madicken Munk's NPRE555 course 
at the University of Illinois. 


## Syllabus

The syllabus will be kept up to date in this repository. It is subject to 
change, so please keep checking it.

## Updating the notebooks

Periodically, I will make changes to the material in this repository
and add new content throughout the semester. While GitHub will reflect these
changes, your local machines may not.  
If you have not installed git, you will need to re-download the
zip file. If you *have* installed git, navigate to your npre247 directory and
type the following:

```
git pull origin 23-fall
```

**Note that most conventions you will see in git instructions will use `master` 
 or `main` rather than `23-fall` like I have here.**

You may run into errors at this point if you have made edits and not committed
your changes.  Or, indeed, if you have made changes to the same lines to which
I have made changes, you may have a conflict. In either case, try to follow the
instructions that `git` gives you. Usually, it will tell you exactly what to
do.  If that's not enough, [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) is
a great tutorial on using git effectively.

## Attribution of re-used materials

Much of this content is a reflection of the course materials originally
developed by Prof. Kathryn Huff (@katyhuff) at the University of Illinois at Urbana
Champaign. Specifically the Syllabus and course outline are heavily
influenced by this content. You can find it at:
https://github.com/katyhuff/npre55 . It, like this version of the course, is
CC-BY-4.0 licensed.  

I also would like to thank 
* David Griesheimer of NNL for providing me his 
  Neutron Transport Lecture notes for an equivalent course that he teaches.
* Chris Perfetti at UNM for directing me to his youtube channel with his
  lectures
